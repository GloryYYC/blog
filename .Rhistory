## Limit your inputs
- A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention
- Analysis paranisis
- “ If you wish to improve” Epictetus said, “ be content to appear clueless in extraneous matters”
- “ The one thing I am sure is my ignorance for everything”
- There is ego in trying to stay on top of everything
- costed our peace of mind and have opportunity cost
## Empty the mind
- meditate
- Be present
- This is the way
- “Emptiness is the fast of the mind”
- modern people with internet are mentally over fed
- Too work up with a problem is self defeating
- Do long, low intensity work (e.g. shooting arrow, golf, long distance riding) to take you mind off, but not unfocus, like meditating
- (Summarizing reading)
## Slow down, think deeply
- What is essential is invisible to the eye
- No one gets there by focusing on what is obvious, or sticking with the first thought that pops into their head ( your first thought/ draft rarely be your best)
## Start journaling
- Journaling as a form of therapy, meditation
- “hypomnemata” notes to oneself
- Weapon of spiritual combat, to silence the barking dogs in your head
- “Where am i standing in my own way? What is the smallest step I can take toward a big thing today? Why am I so worked up about this? Why do I care so much about impressing people? What is the harder choice I am avoiding? Do I rule my fear, or do they rule me? how will today’s difficulties reveal my character?”
## Cultivate silence
- Deliberately create a absence of voice
- We have to step away from the comfort of noisy distractions and stimulation ( your current work)
- We have to start listening
## Seek wisdom
- Don’t stop learning
- Stop learning is allowing your ergo work over you
- Reading with arrogance or confirming preexiting opinions do not help
- Seek teachers (be it people or books)
## Find confidence, avoid ego
- Avoid:
- Driven by ego or hubris
- Paralyzed by fear and doubt
- Ego is self sabotaging and painful and lonely
- Confidence is:
- The freedom to set your own standards
- Unshackle yourself from the need to prove yourself
- Admitting you’re incorrect opinion
- Believing you have all it takes to face the responsibility
- With confidence comes with:
- openness
- Reflective
- able to see themselfe without blinders
- Room for stillness, by removing unnecessary confict and uncertainty and resentment
## Let go
- Too much willful will
- “... It should happen like this ...”
- “... My model is correct ...”
- There is ego in that
“The hits on the target”, Kenzo said,” are only the outward proof and confirmation of your purposelessness at its highest, of your egolessness your self abandonment, or *stillness*.”
