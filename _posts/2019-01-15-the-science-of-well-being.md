### Annoying Feature

1. Our minds' strongest intuition are often totally wrong
2. Our minds don't think in terms of absolute
3. Our minds are built to get used to stuff
4. We don't relize that our minds are built to get used to stuff e.g. shopaholic
5. The tendency to overestimate emotional impact of a future event both in terms of intensity and duration
   
### To better predict how we are going to feel:

1. Focalism: just think the event individually
2. Psychological immure system: bad events hurts, but it doesn't acturally hurt that much that long, you will get over it with friends and family.

### Action we can take:

1. Set strategies to getting over getting used to stuff, e.g. don't invest in stuff in the first place, for material life is the easiest to get used to. Instead, invest in experience, e.g. vication, art gallery, concert, especially those that can be share and benifit others. (Hence altruism)

### Action thwart hedonic adaptation:

1. Savoring
2. Nagative visualization
3. Make this day your last
4. Gratitude

### Action to reset your reference point:

1. Concretly re-experience
2. concretly observe
3. Avoid scial comparisions
4. Interupt your consumpsion
5. Increase your variety
