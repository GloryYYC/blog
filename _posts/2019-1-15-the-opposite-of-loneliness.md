> We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that’s what I want in life. What I’m grateful and thankful to have found at Yale, and what I’m scared of losing when we wake up tomorrow and leave this place.
>It’s not quite love and it’s not quite community; it’s just this feeling that there are people, an abundance of people, who are in this together.

The opposite of loneliness.
