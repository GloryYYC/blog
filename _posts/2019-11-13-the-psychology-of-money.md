I first started trading is when Futu open in Hong Kong, though I had listen to my dad giving his opinion on the market since I was little,so the interest was always there.For the youngster, always wanted to archive wealth fast and overvalue short term reward a lot of time, but for those who had been through tech bubble, 08 fininal crisis, 03 SARS, will know all too well nothing go up forever, and true success in personal finance is comfortable survirability for the longest way possible as archiving wealth is one thing and keeping it is another, much different practice.
