> It is the capacity to cherish oneself in the face of one’s own imperfections, not because of what one has or what one can do.
                
> It is hard for many successful men, like Thomas, to see the harmful effects of compulsive work until the relational bill comes due.
                
> Whether he knew it or not, Thomas was running. Running toward the goal of financial security, to be sure, but also running from the pain and emptiness he had felt as a child, escaping the sense of unworthiness and emotional impoverishment that had haunted him throughout much of his life.
                
> Until his current crisis, Thomas had managed to salve his psychological wounds partially with ample amounts of external self-esteem supplements—money, prowess, prestige. These were the drugs that sustained him, taking the place of authentic relationships. Like most covertly depressed men, Thomas had trouble bearing real intimacy with others because he could not afford to be emotionally intimate with himself.

>They are like the souls in the lowest rung of Dante’s Inferno, who were not seared in fire but frozen in ice.
                
>In overt depression, the anguish of shame, of the toxic relationship to the self, is endured.
                
> compulsive behavior screened symptoms of loss of pleasure, loss of appetite, inability to concentrate, harsh self-criticism, and despondency.
                
> In the defensive structure of covert depression, the ordinary limits of the self are transcended through intoxication in one of two ways. In the intoxication experience that I call merging,
                
> The relaxation of self-boundaries lies at the core of intoxication with drugs like alcohol, morphine, and heroin. Various forms of bingeing—eating, spending, sex—can provide this same sense of expansion.
                
> The other type of intoxication experience, which I call elevation,
                
> Manic-depression
