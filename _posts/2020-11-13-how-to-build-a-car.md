How to build a car is the autobiography of one of the greatest F1 car designer Adrian Newey.

As a 90s kid, my earliest memory is Micheal Schumachar dominating the grid. I was more recently re-introduced to F1 by Dr. Peter Attia for his love to one of the greatest driver, Aryton Senna.

I learned more about motorsport history in the 80s from his experience on the grid, notaby the Andretti's, IndyCar, the very good looking Leyton House. Also the legends in the field and how they operate, like Ron Dennis, Bernie Ecclestone, Christain Horner; and those who drive his car to victory and the championship: Damon Hill, DC, Seb, Webber and of cause Senna. It is very interesting from the point of view of a relatively young but already accomplished, make a careless mistake and in some way, led to the tragic death of Aryton Senna.Work around the rule, smart solution, bring continuity and improvement to the system, all can be related to the work of programming in a sense. It is in reading such a fasinating autobiography that I found myself could not stop reading it.


Adrian attribute his success to had been dismissive and the strugle to get through university gave him the competitiveless/determination to prove he can succeed.Such competitiveness lead to tunnel vision and become thoughtless as a result and failing to consider the little things that make the people in your life happy and family life smoother.
