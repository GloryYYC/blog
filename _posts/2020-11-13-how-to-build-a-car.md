How to build a car is the autobiography of one of the greatest F1 car designer Adrian Newey. As a 90s kid, my earliest memory is Micheal Schumachar dominating the grid. I was more recently re-introduced to F1 by Dr. Peter Attia for his love to one of the greatest driver, Aryton Senna. I learning more about motorsport history in the 80s. Notaby the Andretti's, the very good looking Leyton House. It is very interesting from the point of view of a relatively young but already accomplished, make a careless mistake and in some way, led to the tragic death of Aryton Senna.Work around the rule, smart solution, bring continuity and improvement to the system, all can be related to the work of programming in a sense. It is in reading such a fasinating autobiography that I found myself could not stop reading it.
