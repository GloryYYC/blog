## 1.

- And than there is matter of arrogant
- To help others, one will have to figure out what others loss would be, but first, one will have to understand oneself

> During the course of the day, he said, each spouse had confessed independently to him to taking antidepressants but didnâ€™t want the other to know. It turned out that they were hiding the same medication in the same house.

- As thearpist, they learned how to accept feedback, tolerate discomfort, become aware of blind spots, and discover the impact of our histories and behaviors on oneself and others.
- Life happen, and therapy helps confront our demons when they pay a visit. And visit they will, because eveyone has demons. The shared demons are testament to the fact that therapist aren't the outlier at all.
- With that, we can create a different relationship/narrative with our demons, one in which we no longer try to reason our way out of an inconveninet inner voice or numb our feelings with distractions like too much wine or food or hours spent surfing the interent ( maybe it is happening right now)
- One of the most important steps in therapy is helping people take responsibility for their current predicaments, because once they realize that they can ( and must) construct their own lives, they're free to generate change.
- But sometimes - more often than we tend to realize - those difficult people are us.
- Sometimes we are the cause of our difficulties. And if we can step out of our own way, something astonishing happens.

## 2. Author's side of story

- By definition, the presenting problem is the issue that sends a person into  therapy. It might be a panic attack, a job loss, a death, a birth, a relational difficulty, an inability to make a big life decision, or a bout of depression. Sometimes the presenting problem is less psecific - afeeling of "stuckness" or the vague but nagging notion that something jsut isn't quite right.
- A common defense mechanism called compartmentalization ( compartmentalize a relationship, behaving differently under different relation)

## 3.

- It is easier and faster to get out of a turnel by getting into it. To start, it is all about one foot at a time, then the other.
- Don't look at 5 feet away, just take a step. And when you've taken that step, take one more, Eventually you'll make it to the shower.
- People may not be able to imagine their depression lifting anytime soon, but they don't need to. Doing something prompts you to do something else, replacing a vicious cycle with a virtuous one. Most big transformations come about from the hundreds of tiny, almost imperceptible, steps we take along the way.

## 4.

- The author had been pointed out that she had been watching a lot of TV every night, like in a pathological way.
    - Just like me after dinner, no one is interested in talking to me and I sort of just watch youtube until I sleep
    - You are not just bored. ( or, perhaps more accurately, the only time I felt the absence of something unpleasant that I couldn't quite put my finger on) If the only thing that keeps you going all day is knowing you'll get to turn on the TV after dinner, you probably are depressed

## 6.

- Depression affect sleep, concentration
- Study after study shows that the most important factor in the success of your treatment is your relationship with the therapist, your expereince of "feeling felt"
- Is not a matter of empathy, it is foundamantally hard to image others expereince ( other than going through with them at the same time)
- empathy, active listening is the Necessary and Sufficient Condition of "feeling felt"
